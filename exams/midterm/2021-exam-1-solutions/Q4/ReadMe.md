# Question 4: Establishing foundations [25 points]

You know that you will have to refactor SuperQuiz's parser for quiz questions soon, as new kinds of questions will be added to satisfy more users.
However, the current parser has no tests, which makes refactorings risky.

Write tests for the parser in `src/test/java/QuizParserTests.java`, without modifying the parser itself nor anything under `src/main/java`.

_You get 10 points if you write useful unit tests that reach 80% of statement coverage in `QuizParser.java`._
_You get 15 more points if you write useful unit tests that reach 100% of branch coverage in `QuizParser.java`._
_If you modify code under `src/main/java`, our grading scripts will likely fail and you will get 0 points._

> :warning: Please double-check your coverage using the report generated by Gradle via `gradlew.bat build` on Windows and `./gradlew build` on Linux and macOS.
> IDEs may have slightly different ways of counting coverage; we will only check the Gradle-generated coverage when grading.
