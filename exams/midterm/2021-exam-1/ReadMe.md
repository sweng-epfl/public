# Software Engineering - Exam 1

Grading will be done on the state of the `exam-GASPAR` repository at **12:00 on Friday, October 22, 2021**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point.

There are two kinds of questions in this exam: free-form theory questions and code questions.
For free-form theory questions, answer in the space indicated by question marks `???`.
For code questions, answer in the files mentioned in the question, without touching other files.

The exam is worth 100 points in total, and it consists of five questions plus a feedback survey:
- [Question 1](Q1.md), worth 8 points
- [Question 2](Q2.md), worth 15 points
- [Question 3](Q3.md), worth 15 points
- [Question 4](Q4/ReadMe.md), worth 25 points
- [Question 5](Q5/ReadMe.md), worth 35 points

The feedback survey is [on Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1166873), worth 2 points.
You must complete it before Friday, October 22, 23:59, but you do not need to do so during the exam.
Your answers are automatically anonymized by Moodle; it only tells us who filled in the survey and who didn't.
