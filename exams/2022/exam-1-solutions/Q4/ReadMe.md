# Question 4: Test Coverage (25 points)

You just implemented the Joke abstraction (`src/main/java/Joke.java`) for the JaaS platform. In order
to integrate your code into the main branch, you must of course write tests for it.

- Write your tests for `Joke.java` in the `src/test/java/JokeTests.java` file. Do not modify any other file.
  Aim for 100% statement coverage and 100% branch coverage.

_You get up to 25 points for useful and maintainable unit tests that fully cover the statements and branches of `Joke.java`._

> [!WARNING]
> Please double-check your coverage using the report generated by Gradle
> via `gradlew.bat build` on Windows and `./gradlew build` on Linux and macOS.
> IDEs may have slightly different ways of counting coverage; we will only check the
> Gradle-generated coverage when grading.
