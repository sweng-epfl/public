# Software Engineering - Exam 2

We will grade the `exam-GASPAR` repository in its state as of **12:00 on Friday, November 18, 2022**, and access to this
repo will be terminated at that time.

There are two kinds of questions in this exam: free-form theory questions and coding questions.
For free-form theory questions, answer in the space indicated by question marks `???`; do not modify any other part of the file.
For coding questions, answer in the files mentioned in the question; do not touch any other files.
Failure to follow these instructions will result in the deduction of points.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use an IDE such as IntelliJ, make sure to import each code question on its own
> by importing its build.gradle file. If you import the entire exam as a project instead, you will get build errors.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to push often, every time you have improved your exam. Check the `Actions` tab to make sure that what you pushed compiles.

The exam is worth 100 points in total, and it consists of five questions plus a feedback survey:

- [Question 1](Q1.md), worth 9 points
- [Question 2](Q2.md), worth 14 points
- [Question 3](Q3.md), worth 15 points
- [Question 4](Q4/), worth 25 points
- [Question 5](Q5/), worth 35 points

The [feedback survey](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1228570) is meant to help us improve SwEng.
If you complete it latest by **23:59 on Friday, November 18, 2022** you will earn 2 points. You do not need to fill it in
during the exam. Your answers are automatically anonymized by Moodle: it only tells us who filled in the survey and who
didn't, but not who provided which answer.
