# Question 5: Separate development (35 points)

Your colleagues wrote a command-line client that lists the user accounts on the platform. Your task is to write a test
suite for this client.

1. Make the _minimal_ modifications necessary in `src/main/java/JaasClient.java` to make it testable:
    - The JaasClient should not have hardcoded dependencies on its environment; and
    - The new implementation should have the same behavior as before
2. Write tests for the modified `JokesClient.java` in `src/test/java/JaasClientTests.java`.

You do not need to worry about running the app, since the JaaS API hasn't been implemented yet! However,
you should make sure that the real dependencies are implemented. You do not need to test `App.java`
or the real dependencies of the app.

_You get 15 points if you make minimal, clean modifications to the code such that it continues to work as
intended when the request succeeds.
You additionally get 20 points if you provide useful and maintainable unit tests that fully cover the branches
of `JaasClient.java`._
