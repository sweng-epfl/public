# Past exams

This folder contains past exams.

:warning: Please note that:
- The material taught this year may not be the same, or in the same order, as previous years;
  thus, you may not be able to (nor expected to) finish previous exams.
- The standards for grading may have gotten higher compared to previous years;
  thus, the solutions here may not represent 100% optimal code with the standards of the current year.
- They were originally published in repositories the staff created for each student;
  in these past exams, if the statement tells you to "push to this repository",
  you should [create a fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and push to your fork instead.
