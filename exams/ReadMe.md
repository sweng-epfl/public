# Past exams

This folder contains past exams.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that:
> - The material taught this year may not be the same, or in the same order, as previous years;
>   thus, you may not be able to (nor expected to) finish previous exams.
> - The standards for grading may have gotten higher compared to previous years;
>   thus, the solutions here may not represent 100% optimal code with the standards of the current year.
> - They were originally published in repositories the staff created for each student;
>   in these past exams, if the statement tells you to "push to this repository",
>   you should [create a fork of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and push to your fork instead.
