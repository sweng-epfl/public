# Software Engineering - Exam 2

Grading will be done on the state of the `exam-GASPAR` repository at **12:00 on Friday, November 19, 2021**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point.

There are two kinds of questions in this exam: free-form theory questions and code questions.
For free-form theory questions, answer in the space indicated by question marks `???`.
For code questions, answer in the files mentioned in the question, without touching other files.

> :information_source: If you use an IDE such as IntelliJ, make sure to import each code question on its own
> by importing its build.gradle file. If you import the entire exam as a project instead, you will get build errors.

The exam is worth 100 points in total, and it consists of five questions plus a feedback survey:
- [Question 1](Q1.md), worth 10 points
- [Question 2](Q2.md), worth 15 points
- [Question 3](Q3.md), worth 15 points
- [Question 4](Q4/README.md), worth 19 points
- [Question 5](Q5/README.md), worth 39 points

The feedback survey is [on Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=1182061), worth 2 points.
You must complete it before Friday, November 19, 23:59, but you do not need to do so during the exam.
Your answers are automatically anonymized by Moodle; it only tells us who filled in the survey and who didn't.
