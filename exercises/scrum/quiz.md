## Waterfall

For which of the following scenarios is the Waterfall model most appropriate?

- [ ] While working with the Junior Entreprise EPFL, a talented web developer has to work on a new project with a client who wants a website for his company.

- [ ] The Volare Space Robotics Challenge was a contest organized by the ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) and ESA (European Space Agency). The goal was to make high-school students design robots that unload cargo from ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle, while avoiding objects. 
- [ ] An EPFL graduate has been employed by a start-up as a software engineer, to work with a team of 10 people (electrical engineers, computer scientists and mechanical engineers). The start-up is developing a new robot that should revolutionize industrial manufacturing. The product is based on an entire suite of technical innovations in AI, motor control, computer vision and materials.
- [ ] The SBB/CFF wants an external software company to develop a brand new app for smartphones. The app should replace most of the services offered by SBB customer service assistants at rail stations. All initial requirements for the app have been written down. However, there are some features that are not covered by the current requirements, but SBB might like to add to a future version of the application.
