## Software testing

### Question 1

Testing of a real-world program helps to:

- [ ] Reduce its risk of failure
- [ ] Eliminate all its bugs
- [ ] Decrease bug density
- [ ] Prove its correctness

### Question 2

Which of the following is a valid illustration of the bug → error → failure sequence of events? (Check all that apply)

- [ ] A "for" loop was written such that it mistakenly omits incrementing its counter → the loop spins indefinitely → the program hangs
- [ ] A client sends an invalid HTTP request → the server returns a message with a 400 Bad Request header → the client crashes
- [ ] A server does not sanitize the input received from a client → the SQL statement executed as a result is altered → all server data is lost or corrupted
- [ ] A USB device is connected to a computer → the device is incompatible with the operating system → the operating system displays a "device unknown" message

## Test-driven development

### Question 1

TDD is mostly useful for (check all that apply):

- [ ] testing program logic
- [ ] testing that a user interface is user-friendly
- [ ] testing individual classes and methods
- [ ] testing large code bases of legacy code

### Question 2

What are the problems of TDD raised in the discussion between Jim Coplien and Uncle Bob?

- [ ] It increases the total number of bugs in the code
- [ ] It is not accepted by management
- [ ] It causes developers to not think enough about the architecture of their system
- [ ] TDD is called "unprofessional"
- [ ] TDD leads to bad GUI design

### Question 4

Which of the following is (are) true regarding the debate between Jim Coplien and Uncle Bob? (Select all that apply)

- [ ] They both think that a modern software engineer must adopt TDD
- [ ] Coplien favors CDD over TDD
- [ ] Uncle Bob thinks that TDD's "write tests and then write code" cycles need to be short
- [ ] They both believe that a software system's architecture emerges naturally from TDD
