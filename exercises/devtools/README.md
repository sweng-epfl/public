# DevTools Exercises
These exercises will help you get started with git and use it in a way that will maximize collaboration and minimize conflicts between developers. 
This exercise set assumes you have completed at least [Part 1](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/Bootcamp#part-i) of the SwEng bootcamp, and are familiar with `git init, add, commit, push, status` commands, and familiar with the command line and running `git` from the command line.

The warmup [quiz](quiz.md) will allow you to check how familiar you are with the course content.
The first exercise [ex1](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/exercises/tree/master/devtools/ex1) will teach you about commits in general and how to write effective commit messages.
The second exercise [ex2](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/exercises/tree/master/devtools/ex2) will teach (or refresh) you about the basics of compiling and debugging Java programs from the command line.
The third exercise [ex3](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/exercises/tree/master/devtools/ex3) shows you how to effectively use the branching and merging model for collaborative software development.
The fourth exercise [ex4](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/exercises/tree/master/devtools/ex4) shows you how to compile and debug Java projects using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
