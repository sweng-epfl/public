## Exercise: MVC in Java

In this exercise, we have an implementation of the [Rock-Paper-Scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in the packages `model`, `view`, and `controller` respectively.

Specifically you can see a game between the computer and itself (`COMPUTER_VS_COMPUTER`) or you can play against
the computer (`HUMAN_VS_COMPUTER`). 

There are some small parts of the code that are missing (search for the `TODO` string) and that you need to fill in for the Rock-Paper-Scissor game to work. While filling in this code, make sure you understand how the different components interact with each other.

Bonus: Implement a GUI version of the game using Java Swing. Do you need to change part of your existing code to do so?
