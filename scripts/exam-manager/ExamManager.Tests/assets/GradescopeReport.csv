Assignment Submission ID,Question Submission ID,Name,SID,Email,Score,Submission Time,Answer to part 1: Explanation that speculatively generating images would improve performance,Answer to part 1: Suggestion to speculatively generate images by predicting topics,Answer to part 1: Suggestion to speculatively generate images by predicting topics,"Answer to part 1: Suggestion to cache images per user, which might work in very specific scenarios but not in the general case asked in the statement",Answer to part 1: Overly vague explanation based on optimizing algorithms without any specifics,Answer to part 2: Explanation that batching images into a single request would improve performance,"Answer to part 2: Suggestion to generate images as the user types, which might work depending on the internals of the image generation algorithm but is not a general solution","Answer to part 2: Suggestion to parallelize client requests, which is better than the current state but does not take advantage of the freedom to change the server interface and thus still results in unnecessary requests","Answer to part 2: Suggestion to batch requests, but the explanation of why it would work better is incorrect (it should be about making fewer requests)","Answer to part 2: Suggestion to batch requests, but without explaining how it would actually work, and especially how the freedom to change the server interface is used","Answer to part 2: Suggestion to show the images one by one instead of waiting, which is an improvement but does not use the freedom to change the server interface and thus still results in unnecessary requests",Answer to part 2: Answer to the second sub-question essentially duplicates the one given in the first sub-question,"Answer to part 2: Suggestion to cache requests across users, which is better than the current state but does not take advantage of the freedom to change the server interface and thus still results in unnecessary requests, plus it's not clear whether many users will ask for the same thing","Answer to part 2: Suggestion to speculatively generate images, which does not require client changes and is a very hard problem to solve as it requires speculating on text",Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the common case first,"Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the common case first, and that relative speedup is also important here","Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the common case first, and that the moderation case has little impact on user experience","Answer to part 3: Suggestion based on the absolute time improvements, even though the moderation process is stated to take a day overall and is presumably less frequent",Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the most gains in relative terms,Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the most gains,Answer to part 3: Explanation that one should optimize for the most gains in relative terms,"Answer to part 3: Suggestion to optimize image generation first, but makes incorrect assumptions about the server","Answer to part 3: Suggestion based on the absolute time improvements, even though the moderation process is stated to take a day overall and is presumably less frequent",Answer to part 3: Overly vague suggestion for improvement,Overly verbose answer to the first sub-question,Bonus for some reason,Overly verbose answer to the third sub-question,SKIP|No points,Adjustment,Comments,Grader,Tags
