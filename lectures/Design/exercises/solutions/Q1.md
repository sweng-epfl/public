# Evaluation Criteria

- Justify the reasons why these two propositions are bad
- Answer that the proposals are not correct; but that is not useful without justification

# Proposed Solution

The first idea is wrong, the second uses the wrong name.

In the first case, even if the interface remains the same since we are dealing with character strings, a decorator does
not make sense because the class returning JSON cannot be used without this decorator; the logic for extracting the
weather prediction naturally belongs to the weather client in question. It is therefore better to create a class containing
both the download of the JSON and the extraction of the weather forecast.

In the second case, it is not a _decorator_ since the exposed interface is different from the wrapped one. It's an _adapter_.
