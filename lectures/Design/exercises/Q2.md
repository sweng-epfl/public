The Java programming language offers a rich set of features that can be used to implement a wide
variety of applications. However, the language also suffers from a number of problems that can
make it difficult to use. Here are two examples:

- [`java.lang.Cloneable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.html)
  is an unusual interface. Why is this problematic?
- [`java.util.Stack`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)
  has a surprising inheritance hierarchy. Why is this problematic?
  Additionally, the `search` method uses a particular
  convention for its return value. What is the main "surprise" this method could give to a
  developer who is experienced with other parts of the Java standard library?
