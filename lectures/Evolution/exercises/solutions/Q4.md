# Proposed Solution

## Package `one`

The type of duplication was **sibling class**. We directly see that
the `doExercise()` method is common to all classes, so we _pull up_ the method
into the `Exercise` superclass. We notice that there are still some
similarities. For example there is a common `weight` attribute in
the `Benchpress` and `Deadlift` classes, and their `requiresWeight()`
and `getWeight()` methods are also identical. These can be again _pulled up_
into a new superclass that we name `WeightedExercise`. Similarly, we create
a `UnweightedExercise` class that can be extended by `Pushup` and `Squat`.

```java
public class Benchpress extends WeightedExercise {

    public Benchpress(int weight) {
        super("benchpress", weight);
    }
}

public class Deadlift extends WeightedExercise {

    public Deadlift(int weight) {
        super("deadlift", weight);
    }
}

public abstract class Exercise {
    String name;

    public Exercise(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void doExercise() {
        System.out.println("Wow, I totally just did a " + name);
    }

    public abstract boolean requiresWeight();
}

public class Pushup extends UnweightedExercise {
    public Pushup() {
        super("push-up");
    }
}

public class Squat extends UnweightedExercise {
    public Squat() {
        super("squat");
    }
}

public abstract class UnweightedExercise extends Exercise {

    public UnweightedExercise(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean requiresWeight() {
        return false;
    }
}

public abstract class WeightedExercise extends Exercise {
    protected int weight;

    public WeightedExercise(String name, int weight) {
        super(name);
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean requiresWeight() {
        return true;
    }

    public int getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }
}
```

The refactoring technique used is **Pull Up Method** and **Pull Up Attribute**.

## Package `two`

The type of duplication was **same class**. First of all, we see that a new
instance of `Scanner` is created in each method. We can _extract_ it into a
static field of the class and make it available to all methods. Next, we notice
that the methods have a very similar structure e.g. ask a question, get the
answer and print the greeting message. We can _extract_ this behavior into
separate methods. Finally, we can also make the questions we ask into constants,
as they are reused ("_Please enter your first name_" is used in 3 different
methods).

```java
public class Greeter {

    private Greeter() {
    }

    private static final Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);

    private static final String FIRST_NAME_REQUEST = "Please enter your first name:";
    private static final String LAST_NAME_REQUEST = "Please enter your last name:";
    private static final String AGE_REQUEST = "Please enter your age:";

    private static final String ageFormat = "(%s years old)";

    // prints: Nice to meet you Willy
    public static void askForFirstName() {
        greet(ask(FIRST_NAME_REQUEST));
    }

    // prints: Nice to meet you Wonka
    public static void askForLastName() {
        greet(ask(LAST_NAME_REQUEST));
    }

    // prints: Nice to meet you Willy Wonka
    public static void askForFullName() {
        greet(ask(FIRST_NAME_REQUEST), ask(LAST_NAME_REQUEST));
    }

    // prints: Nice to meet you Willy Wonka (23 years old)
    public static void askForFullNameAndAge() {
        String firstName = ask(FIRST_NAME_REQUEST);
        String lastName = ask(LAST_NAME_REQUEST);
        String age = ask(AGE_REQUEST);
        greet(firstName, lastName, String.format(ageFormat, age));
    }

    private static String ask(String question) {
        System.out.println(question);
        return s.next();
    }

    private static void greet(String... data) {
        StringBuilder message = new StringBuilder("Nice to meet you ");
        for (String s : data)
            message.append(s).append(" ");
        System.out.println(message.toString().strip());
    }
}
```

The refactoring techniques used are **Extract Method**, **Extract Constant** and
**Extract Field**.

## Package `three`

The type of duplication was **different class**. Here we notice that both
classes have very similar methods: one for getting a sorted subset of a list and
one for printing the result. We decide to _extract_ a new, separate class (in
our case `TopNPrinter`) and _move_ the methods there. Each class can now have an
instance of `TopNPrinter` and rely on its methods.

A typical example of how different class duplication is handled are projects
that work extensively with matrices (array of arrays in java). Usually, you will
have a separate `Matrix` class that defines many useful methods such
as `transpose`, `multiply`, `invert`, ...

```java
public class TopNPrinter<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    private int N;
    private String header;

    public TopNPrinter(int N, String header) {
        this.N = N;
        this.header = header;
    }

    private List<T> getTopN(List<T> list) {
        List<T> copy = new ArrayList<>(list);
        Collections.sort(copy);
        return copy.subList(0, N);
    }

    public void prettyPrintTopN(List<T> list) {
        System.out.println(header);
        int i = 1;
        for (T t : getTopN(list))
            System.out.println(i++ + ") " + t);
    }
}

public class Hitparade {
    // sorry if your favorite song didn't make the cut, you can add it if you want!
    private static List<Song> songs = Arrays.asList(
        new Song("Never Gonna Give You Up", "Rick Astley", 8),
        new Song("Friday", "Rebecca Black", 1),
        new Song("CHIHUAHUA", "DJ BoBo", 5),
        new Song("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", 5),
        new Song("Take On Me", "A-ha", 7),
        new Song("Africa", "Toto", 10),
        new Song("Gucci Gang", "Lil Pump", 5),
        new Song("Gangnam Style", "PSY", 5));

    // define a new printer
    private static TopNPrinter<Song> printer = new TopNPrinter<>(3, "====TOP SONGS====");

    // prints the top 3 most popular songs in a nice way
    public static void prettyPrintMostPopularSongs() {
        printer.prettyPrintTopN(songs);
    }

    // other methods like:
    // getMostTrendingArtists()
    // getTopSellingRockAlbum()
    // ...


    static private class Song implements Comparable<Song> {
        String name;
        String artist;
        int popularity;

        Song(String name, String artist, int popularity) {
            this.name = name;
            this.artist = artist;
            this.popularity = popularity;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Song o) {
            return Integer.compare(o.popularity, this.popularity);
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return artist + " - " + name;
        }
    }

}

public class Satellite {
    // ratings are subjective, sorry if your favorite beer didn't make the cut, you can add it if you want!
    private static List<Beer> beers = Arrays.asList(new Beer("Cuvée des Trolls", 8),
        new Beer("Lupulus", 9),
        new Beer("Kwak", 10),
        new Beer("Punk IPA", 7),
        new Beer("Gurten", 5),
        new Beer("Wittekop", 4),
        new Beer("Brooklyn Lager", 6),
        new Beer("CoCo POW!", 0));

    // define a new printer
    private static TopNPrinter<Beer> printer = new TopNPrinter<>(5, "====TOP BEERS====");

    // prints the top 3 most popular songs in a nice way
    public static void prettyPrintMostPopularSongs() {
        printer.prettyPrintTopN(beers);
    }

    // Other methods like:
    // getOpeningHours()
    // getPizzaOfTheDayTopping()
    // getMostPopularNonAlcoholicBeverages()
    // ...

    static private class Beer implements Comparable<Beer> {
        String name;
        int popularity;

        Beer(String name, int popularity) {
            this.name = name;
            this.popularity = popularity;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Beer o) {
            return Integer.compare(o.popularity, this.popularity);
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return name;
        }
    }
}
```

The refactoring techniques used are **Extract Class** and **Move Method**.

## Package `four`

The type of duplication was **different algorithm**. We see that the class uses
3 different ways of computing the approximation of PI, however the result is (
more or less) the same each time. We choose the simplest of the 3 algorithms
and _substitute_ the other two by the one we chose. Then, we can _extract_ the
approximation of PI into a separate method.

Please note that doing the computation each time is not very efficient. We could
instead store the value in a constant and return it each time, or even better,
use `Math.PI` which is provided by the Java standard library.

```java
public final class Circle {

    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double getRadius() {
        return radius;
    }

    public void setRadius(double radius) {
        if (radius > 0)
            this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double perimeter() {
        return 2 * approximatePI() * radius;
    }

    public double area() {
        return approximatePI() * radius * radius;
    }

    public double arcLength(double angleInDegrees) {
        return angleInDegrees / 360 * perimeter();
    }

    private double approximatePI() {
        return 104348.0 / 33215.0;
    }
}
```

The refactoring techniques used are **Substitute Algorithm** and **Extract
Method**.
