The company in which you work has just hired a new CTO, freshly graduated from a very theoretical university.

The CTO decides that in order to minimize bugs in the product, all new code must now be covered at least 80% in terms of paths in the code.

Is this a good idea, and why? Can you suggest something better, given the CTOâ€™s objective?
