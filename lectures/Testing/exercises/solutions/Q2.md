# Evaluation criteria

- The answer must be based on the definition of path coverage. 
- The answer should keep the CTO's objective in mind, but propose a more realistic strategy


# Suggested solution

Covering 80% of the paths is often either undoable or a waste of time.
For example, any potentially infinite loop such as requiring a valid user input can't be covered more than 0% in terms of paths.
Even for the rest of the code, there are often so many paths that covering 80% of them would take a huge amount of time.

A more realistic strategy would be to cover at least 80% of the branches, or perhaps 80% of the instructions.
