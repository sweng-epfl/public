You are chatting during lunch break with a colleague who complains about the time she spent to find the cause of a bug:

> The error actually came from our "optimized" version of array sorting! Due to an "off-by-one" calculation in the sorting
> logic, the result was not sorted correctly. The rest of the application assumes that the array is sorted, so the coefficient
> calculated by module X was negative, which should never happen. Module Y was therefore calculating absurd results, which were
> then used by module Z to make requests to our server, which therefore failed with an "invalid input" exception.

What can you suggest to this colleague so that she spends less time next time? Is it possible to get some of the
advantages of your solution with only some of the disadvantages, or is it an "all or nothing" solution?
