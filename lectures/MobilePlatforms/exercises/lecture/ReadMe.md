# Lecture exercises

In preparation for Friday's lecture, we ask you
to [set up your Android Studio environment](setup.md) and to run the SwEng App project.

During the lecture, we will go through a few basics of Android development. First,
we'll [create another activity](button.md). Then,
we'll [implement navigation between the two activities and we'll see how to display a list of items on the screen](navigation.md)
.
