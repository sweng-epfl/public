# Evaluation Criteria

- Shows a good understanding on what is an Intent and it's different use cases.

# Proposed Solution

If she doesn't need to have a custom camera feature, then she should simply use the set of core apps that comes with
an android by default. The way this can be done is by using an implicit intent. She needs to include just enough
information in the intent about the task she wants to perform. The Android system matches the information
in the requested intent with activities available on the device that can perform that task (e.g. a camera, or pdf
viewer).
