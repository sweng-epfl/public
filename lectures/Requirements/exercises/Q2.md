You're working for a startup that develops a university management app.
You just received a description of what the app should do:

> This app will be the administrative backbone of the university.
> Almost all staff will use it.
> Human Resources will register each student, including their personal details,
> and use the system to ensure each student follows the rules concerning the duration of studies,
> the number of courses that must be taken, the payment of all applicable fees...
> Professors will use the app to input grades and to send informational messages to students in their courses.
> Students will be able to see the list of courses, register for a course, and see their grades.
> Students will also be able to pay fees and update their personal details from the app.
> Staff members will also be able to update their personal details, including their banking coordinates for their salary.

Your task is to extract user stories from this description, by thinking about what each kind of user might want from this app.

_This exercise does not have an exact solution; try to write at least 4 stories._
