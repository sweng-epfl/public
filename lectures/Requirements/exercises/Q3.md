You are developing in a team a recipe management and culinary inspiration app.

You had given your intern the task of creating "personas" for your users, but it seems the intern has not quite followed the software engineering course,
because the resulting personas are as follows:

> Ana, manager, doesn't have the time to look at many recipes nor to do the shopping every day

> Bumi, computer science student, only cooks a few times a week and prefers non-spicy food

> Cath, amateur cook, loves to cook.

What can you say about each of these personas? Should they be changed, and if so, how?
