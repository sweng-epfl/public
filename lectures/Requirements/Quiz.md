2: It's about the "end-to-end" task of checking with users, not with what we think users want such as user stories or interfaces,
and it is by definition not a formal process since it involves humans and subjectivity.

1 & 3: it should be a high-level story rather than lengthy implementation details, and it must clearly state what users want.
However, user stories are not formal, and they must be self-contained.
