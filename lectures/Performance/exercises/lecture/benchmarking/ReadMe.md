The [Java Microbenchmark Harness](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) is a set of tools that help benchmark your code.
It takes into account the warm-up of the JVM and code optimizations that might alter results.

**Build and run the benchmark using `gradlew.bat jmh` on Windows or `./gradlew jmh` on macOS and Linux.**

You will see the progress of the benchmark. When it's done, JMH will present the results.
