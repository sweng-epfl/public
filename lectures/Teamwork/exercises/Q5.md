# Code Review

In a typical collaborative software development workflow, code must be peer reviewed before being integrated. This
usually takes the form of a pull request review on a git hosting service (e.g. Github). This insures the quality of the
code in terms of following the best practices and conventions set by the team.

As a code review exercise:

1) Please fork the following [repository](https://github.com/sweng-epfl/code-review).

    - At the top right of the page, click on the Fork button.
    - Uncheck the box that says `copy the main branch only`
    - Click on the `Create fork` button.

> This will redirect you to your newly created/forked repository under your namespace.

2) Create a new pull request to merge the changes from the branch `feature/order-service` to the main branch

    - Click on the `pull request` tab, and then on the `New pull request` button.
    - Set the base branch to `main` and the compare branch to `feature/order-service`

3) Perform a pull request review (smelly code, performance optimization, bugs, etc..)
